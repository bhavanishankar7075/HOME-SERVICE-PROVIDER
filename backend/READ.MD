That is the perfect question to ask next.

When your website is deployed on a live server, the process is much simpler because you will have a permanent, public URL. You will no longer need the stripe listen command.

Here is the exact process for your live website.

The Process for Your Deployed (Live) Website
Step 1: Deploy Your Backend and Get Your Public URL
First, you will deploy your backend code to a hosting service (like Vercel, Heroku, Render, AWS, etc.). After deploying, your server will have a public URL.

For example, your URL might be: https://api.yourservicehub.com

This means your webhook handler will be publicly accessible at: https://api.yourservicehub.com/api/payments/stripe-webhook

Step 2: Create a New Webhook Endpoint in Stripe
Log in to your Stripe Dashboard. You will probably switch from "Test mode" to "Live mode".

In the menu, go to Developers, then click on Webhooks.

Click the "+ Add an endpoint" button.

Step 3: Configure Your Live Endpoint
A form will appear (this is the same page from your earlier screenshot). You will fill it out with your live server's information.

Endpoint URL: Here, you will paste the full public URL to your webhook handler.

Example: https://api.yourservicehub.com/api/payments/stripe-webhook

Events to send: Click the "Select events" button and choose the same five events we discussed before:

checkout.session.completed

customer.subscription.updated

customer.subscription.deleted

payment_intent.succeeded

payment_intent.payment_failed

Click the "Add endpoint" button at the bottom.

Step 4: Get Your LIVE Webhook Secret
After creating the endpoint, Stripe will show you a new signing secret. This is your production webhook secret (it will also start with whsec_...). Copy it.

Step 5: Set Your Production Environment Variables
On your hosting provider's dashboard, you need to set the environment variables for your live application.

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Set this to your LIVE secret key from Stripe (it will start with sk_live_...).

STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Set this to the new production secret you just copied in Step 4.

PROVIDER_FRONTEND_URL: Update this to your live frontend URL (e.g., https://www.yourservicehub.com).

Summary: Local vs. Live
Local Development: You use the stripe listen command. It creates a temporary connection and gives you a temporary secret for testing.

Live Production: You create a permanent webhook endpoint in the Stripe dashboard that points to your public server URL, and you use the permanent secret it gives you in your server's environment variables.

That's it. Your backend code is already written to handle this. You just need to do this one-time configuration when you go live.
